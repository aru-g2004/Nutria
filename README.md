Are you struggling to find delicious meals that fit your lifestyle? Say hello to Nutria, a revolutionary cross-platform app developed with Flutter and powered by the Gemini API, designed to transform your meal planning and health management.

To deliver truly personalized recommendations, Nutria starts by asking you to fill out a detailed form sharing your dietary restrictions, gut health, cooking comfort, favorite cuisines, and more. This information allows Nutria to suggest appropriate meals based on the time of day and your unique needs. Nutria refines its recommendations as it gets to know you better. Primed with the user's information, Nutria's chat feature, powered by the Gemini API, provides 24/7 personalized advice.

Nutria goes beyond basic meal suggestions with specialized modes like Snack Mode, Dessert Mode, List Mode, and Restaurant Mode to discover nearby options that match your preferences. Nutria has a list mode which uses Gemini's image capabilities to suggest meals based on your inventory. You can also snap a photo of your fridge or restaurant menu, and get instant meal ideas tailored to what you have on hand or what looks good. 

Built with Flutter for seamless cross-platform use, Nutria prioritizes a user-friendly experience and reliable performance. Additional features include Google sign-in via Firebase, easy access to your favorite meals and recipes, and a commitment to making a positive impact on your well-being. You are what you eat so make it count!
